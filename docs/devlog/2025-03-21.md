- [x] Create basic version of UI based on Linear as reference
- [x] Handle proper theming of the markdown editor
- [x] Make it such that the markdown editor is seen / hidden based on the secondary sidebar

- [x] research on tauri

- [x] add in file system plugin
- [x] create new kanban boards

- [ ] Autosave of kanban boards based on store
- [ ] delete kanban boards
- [ ] separate file path from the name of the board (allowing boards to be arbitrarily renamed)

- [ ] change font size and colour of normal text (slightly smaller)
- [ ] change right sidebar shortcut and add focus on toggle

- [ ] Symlink to existing markdown files in the file system - how to handle asking for permissions?
- [ ] A way of showing errors in the right way
- [ ] View when selecting the text vs not - e.g. images, headings, list checkboxes, etc.

## Kanban Persistence

Our data model is to read all the files into memory on startup.

We can update the state in the in-memory DB which flushes the writes to disk.
Create a basic `store` that is used (no need to add Zustand,
just try implementing it myself).

Once loaded, then we can use the store to persist the data.

This is just the initial version.
Eventually I do want to be able to store the markdown files anywhere
and just maintain the symlink to the file so that I can store the markdown
files in Obsidian and elsewhere.

The markdown names should probably be unique in some way -
perhaps generating a UUID for each file.

This way, we can have the "title" of the Kanban board be determined
by the Heading 1 in the markdown file and we have a stable identity for the kanbans.

## Data model

Currently the data model is quite confusing.
There are some unnecessary elements like metadata.

Let's go back to the basics: how do we store the kanban board?

It should be in *markdown* format, which is something like a
**serialization** of our kanban board object.

When we start the application, we deserialize all the markdown files
and store them in the global store.

The key elements of the kanban board are:

- `id`: some persistent identifier (likely the filename - generate uuid)
- `title`: determined from the H1 of the markdown file
- `columns`: column names are determined by the H2 headings of the markdown file
- `tasks`: individual tasks under each column, which is just a string of text with the 
  boolean property of `completed`

With these elements we can render everything and thus avoid
storing duplicates of the data.

- No title = untitled
- No column name = not parsed as a column.
- Tasks that don't fall under a H2 - not parsed
- Tasks without description - not parsed

^ these would be useful test cases to have.

### Handling the Editor

For the editor, we can just dynamically convert the kanban structure
into markdown each time.
If performance is an issue, then we store the markdown string but we
shouldn't optimise prematurely.

How about handling the re-rendering of the editor only when the
kanban board structure is updated from somewhere else,
i.e. not the editor itself?

We can update the `setState` function to have an optional `message: string`
as the second argument.
This message is sent to all the listeners of the store (optionally),
allowing us to differentiate between updates from the editor
vs updates from elsewhere.

Updates from else where should trigger a re-render in the editor -
perhaps generating some kind of key?
More research is needed.
