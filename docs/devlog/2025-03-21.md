## Kanban Persistence

Our data model is to read all the files into memory on startup.

We can update the state in the in-memory DB which flushes the writes to disk.
Create a basic `store` that is used (no need to add Zustand,
just try implementing it myself).

Once loaded, then we can use the store to persist the data.

This is just the initial version.
Eventually I do want to be able to store the markdown files anywhere
and just maintain the symlink to the file so that I can store the markdown
files in Obsidian and elsewhere.

The markdown names should probably be unique in some way -
perhaps generating a UUID for each file.

This way, we can have the "title" of the Kanban board be determined
by the Heading 1 in the markdown file and we have a stable identity for the kanbans.
