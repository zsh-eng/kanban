## Prototyping

Did a bit of prototyping today.

I've always preferred typing out my todos in a list format (at least on desktop) because it's so much easier to just use Vim keybindings to navigate around and edit text.

But I also think that Kanban boards are really good for viewing the tasks that you have in an organized manner.

`obsidian-kanban` sort of does this, but there were a few things that I wanted to learn about:

1. Exploring this idea of having a separate input vs viewing model and having the updates reflected instantly when you change each side (no debouncing) - obsidian kanban
2. Creating Desktop applications with Tauri
3. Working with CodeMirror and comparing the differences with Lexical
4. Implementing drag and drop
5. Building meaningful keyboard navigation within a webapp (how to handle focusing different panes, navigating different tasks, etc.)

## Updating on every keystroke

Turns out performance is a big issue even when you reach something like 30 tasks, and there is a noticeable delay between the keystroke and the UI updating.

I tried debouncing.
Unacceptable - the UI should update immediately, not after X amount of time, even with a small debounce timer (like 50ms).

To be honest, I couldn't really tell what was causing the delay, whether it was the rendering or something else.
For once, I made use of `react-devtools` and I saw the rendering itself only takes about a few ms.
The bulk of the time is spent parsing the markdown AST - rendering is only a few ms, while generating the kanban board structure is like 50ms.
It's a number that's too high if we're trying to update on each keystroke.

I considered a few solutions for speeding things up:

1. Parser: Create a custom parser, a simplified version of remark - I don't need remark to parse all the markdown constructs. The issues I foresaw were (1) I don't know if this would improve the time and (2) even if it did it may not be significant. I might still do this to reduce dependencies and for the sake of learning about parsers.
2. Graph: Have some kind of graph representation of the Kanban board. Instead of regenerating the board object each time, we could get CodeMirror to just emit the changes and we only change the dirty nodes. Problem with this is that there isn't really a stable identity for the nodes given that it's just plain text and I wanted to keep it that way for now. Lexical uses a graph representation for the text editor, so that's something to consider if I ever move there.
3. Web Workers: Offload the expensive computation to a Web Worker. I also considered offloading the work to Tauri but I think in this case it's unnecessary.

Number 3 worked quite well in the end, and now it's able to handle updates with every keystroke.
I think I've learnt enough to actually nuke this and implement the project for real.
