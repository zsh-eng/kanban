## TODO

- [ ] refactor kanban persistence state

- [ ] Autosave of kanban boards based on store
- [ ] delete kanban boards
- [ ] separate file path from the name of the board (allowing boards to be arbitrarily renamed)

- [ ] change font size and colour of normal text (slightly smaller)
- [ ] change right sidebar shortcut and add focus on toggle

- [ ] Symlink to existing markdown files in the file system - how to handle asking for permissions?
- [ ] A way of showing errors in the right way
- [ ] View when selecting the text vs not - e.g. images, headings, list checkboxes, etc.

- [ ] Read through zustand source code for basic [store implementation](https://x.com/dai_shi/status/1903962704836165902/photo/1)
